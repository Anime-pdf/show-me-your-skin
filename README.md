## Truly flexible

Below are a few examples of the flexibility this mod offers. You can
fully cater the settings to your preference, and change them on the fly if needed.

## Context-sensitive hiding

Armor can be restored to vanilla behavior based on certain conditions, 
such as being in combat. This means the armor will be shown for a
configurable amount of seconds after a player is damaged.

## Multiplayer support

When the mod is installed on a server, it'll enter "server mode" and any settings 
you configure for yourself will be visible in real-time to other players. 
Though admins can enforce certain restrictions on what settings are available 
if they feel the need for it.

When the mod is only installed on your client however, you'll be able to
configure personal settings for every player on the server. Though these are
only visible to you.

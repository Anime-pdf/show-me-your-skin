## So many possibilities!

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Remove enchant glint</th>
    <th>Hide specific <br>armor pieces</th>
    <th>Add transparency</th>
    <th>Create an aura-like <br>effect by keeping the <br>enchant glint with low <br>armor transparency</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><img src="img/no-enchants.gif" height="320"/></td>
    <td><img src="img/pieces.gif" height="320"/></td>
    <td><img src="img/transparency.gif" height="320"/></td>
    <td><img src="img/aura.gif" height="320"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

## Context-sensitive hiding

Armor can be restored to vanilla behavior based on certain conditions, 
such as being in combat. This means the armor will be shown for a
configurable amount of seconds after a player is damaged.

## Per-player overrides

Override values per player in multiplayer using a fancy custom ui.
